"""
spa_core/execution/draft_prep.py — E1 "level-A" UNSIGNED draft preparation.

Owner-greenlit 2026-07-11 (Signals Cabinet / Execution track E1). This is the thin
"prepare a draft for THIS recommendation → present it for human review" layer that
was deliberately deferred until an explicit owner go-ahead (it lives in the
AVOID-listed ``execution/`` tree).

WHAT IT IS (and is NOT)
-----------------------
Given a de-risking *recommendation* (crossing the advisory→execution boundary as
plain DATA — a dict/JSON, never a code import, so ``execution/`` stays isolated from
advisory/paper/monitoring), it produces an **UNSIGNED, human-reviewable draft
transaction**: the exact calldata a person would sign IN THEIR OWN WALLET, plus a
plain-language summary, the evidence level, the tail, and a de-risk-only refusal note.

It is **level A** (a HUMAN signs). It is NOT the Safe 2-of-N co-sign path (level B —
that is ``safe_tx_builder``) and it is emphatically NOT level C (an agent that holds a
key and moves funds — permanently REJECTED).

HARD SAFETY CONTRACT (enforced here + asserted by tests)
--------------------------------------------------------
* **AI NEVER signs / sends / moves funds.** This module produces a *draft*; every
  output carries ``signed=False`` and ``requires_human_signature=True``. It calls NO
  capital primitive (never imports ``eth_signer`` / ``wallet`` / ``mev_protection``),
  touches NO network, and NEVER flips or requires ``SPA_EXEC_ARMED`` (it only *reads*
  the arming posture, read-only, for display).
* **De-risk ONLY.** Any recommendation whose effect would INCREASE exposure
  (allocate / supply / increase / leverage / borrow / stake …) is REFUSED. We only
  ever help a user REDUCE risk.
* **Non-custodial + no fabrication.** Addresses must be real, well-formed, and
  supplied by the caller — a missing/invalid address is a fail-CLOSED refusal, never a
  placeholder. We never invent an address, amount, or APY.
* **Never sell risk as safety.** Every draft must carry an evidence level (L0–L6) and
  a tail note; a recommendation missing either is refused.
* Deterministic, stdlib-only, fail-CLOSED. Same input → byte-identical calldata.

LLM_FORBIDDEN: no LLM calls anywhere in this module.
